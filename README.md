# Wyndo QA, Security, and Reliability

## Overview

  Our capstone team is dedicated to enhancing Wyndo's platform security and user experience. We are achieving this by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities, improving performance, and setting up a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system. This proactive approach ensures a secure and reliable service for all users.

## Problem Statement

  Our project focuses on addressing the current platform vulnerabilities of Wyndo. Given that this platform handles sensitive retailer and customer data, it is crucial to manage this data securely. Our goal is to prevent potential breaches that could compromise user confidentiality and platform integrity, ensuring the security of both retailers and consumers. Since Wyndo has only had a devloper who created their wesbite, we are the first team to go in and implement these in-depth security measures.

## Quantification of Wasted Resources
  The customer's of Wyndo are independent brrick and morter retailers who want to use Wyndo's services to reach customers. If Wyndo is not able to handle their data correctly, it leads to the loss in:
- **Time:** Significant man-hours are wasted in rectifying issues post-breach, which could otherwise be utilized in customer service and improving business operations.
- **Money:** Data breaches can incur hefty fines for non-compliance with data protection regulations, alongside the direct costs associated with resolving these breaches.
- **Other Resources:** The lack of a streamlined and secure system leads to poor resource allocation, such as unnecessary spending on crisis management and damage control, rather than on business growth and development.


## ISBA Subfields
We will be focusing on the ISBA subfields of Business Analytics, Application Development, and Development Operations (DevOps):

1. **Business Analytics** involves analyzing data to make strategic decisions. In the context of the Wyndo project, this could involve analyzing user interactions, system performance data, and transactional metrics to enhance decision-making processes.

2. **Application Development** is focused on creating, testing, and deploying applications. For Wyndo, this means developing a scalable and secure website application that meets the specified business requirements.

3. **DevOps** emphasizes automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction. For Wyndo, DevOps practices are crucial in managing the infrastructure, automating deployments via CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring high availability and minimal downtime.
